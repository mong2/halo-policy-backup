If you choose to use Apache's mod_security and its SecChrootDirective, check \"Active\" for this rule. ----\r\n\r\nSome services are capable of running in a chroot \"jail\" which means the root filesystem directory of the process is isolated. This helps segregate processes that are more exposed to compromise from the rest of the operating system. You can learn more about chroot jails at: \r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot_jail\r\n\r\nPutting Apache in a chroot jail isolates an intruder's scope of access in the event that the Apache web server is compromised. Depending on the configuration of the SecChrootDir option, the web server's scope of filesystem access can be tightly restricted to a small section of the filesystem.\r\n\r\nThe checks below are configured for Apache 2.0, but even within the 2.x releases the chroot jail directives and usage can vary.
